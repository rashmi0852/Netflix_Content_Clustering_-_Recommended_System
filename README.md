# Netflix Content Clustering and Recommendation System

## Overview

The "Netflix Content Clustering and Recommendation System" project embarked on a journey to explore Netflix's extensive library of TV shows and movies. The primary objectives were to cluster content effectively, gain valuable insights into viewer preferences, and create a personalized recommendation system to enhance user experience and reduce subscriber churn.

## Key Steps

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

The project began with the collection of data on Netflix's content library. Information on titles, genres, countries of production, and user reviews was gathered. Data preprocessing included handling missing data, text analysis, and encoding categorical variables for subsequent analysis.

### 2. Clustering Analysis

To understand the inherent structures within the content, two powerful clustering algorithms, K-Means and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering, were employed. These techniques allowed content to be categorized into clusters, with K-Means yielding an optimal cluster count of 4 and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering pointing to 2 clusters as ideal.

### 3. Building a Personalized Recommendation System

The core of the project was the creation of a recommendation system. It utilizes user viewing history, preferences, and behaviors to match subscribers to content clusters that best reflect their tastes. The system suggests content from within the user's cluster and occasionally introduces diversification with adjacent clusters.

## Challenges Encountered

Throughout the project, several challenges emerged, including:

- Data Volume and Quality: Managing a dataset of Netflix's scale can be challenging, with issues related to missing or incomplete data.
- Algorithm Selection: Choosing clustering algorithms and evaluation metrics demanded careful consideration.
- Balancing Personalization and Diversity: Striking the right balance between personalization and diversity in recommendations was complex.
- Interpreting Clusters: Understanding the meaning and implications of content clusters required nuanced interpretation.
- Content and User Privacy: User privacy and data ethics were paramount, ensuring anonymization and ethical data usage.

## Insights and Goals

The project yielded profound insights into Netflix's content and subscriber base, including:

- Diversity of content genres and origin countries.
- Global influences on the streaming industry.
- Regional success stories and cultural impact.
- Viewer engagement preferences.
- Collaboration with prolific directors and actors.

The overarching goal is to enhance user engagement, reduce subscriber churn, and offer diverse, high-quality content and personalized recommendations to resonate with individual tastes.

Netflix's journey continues to shape the entertainment streaming landscape, and this project has contributed to this ongoing evolution.

## Streamlit App

A Streamlit app has been created to demonstrate the recommendation system and provide a user-friendly interface. Users can input their preferred movie or TV show, and the app will provide personalized recommendations based on the clustering and recommendation system developed in this project.

To run the Streamlit app, follow the instructions below:

1. Install Streamlit if not already installed:

2. Save the models by running the ipynb file.

3. Make sure Dataset,Saved model,ipynb file ,streamlit app in same folder
   
5. Run the Streamlit app:


Enjoy exploring personalized recommendations based on the clustering and recommendation system!
